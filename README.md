# EV3 Robot Development

The EV3 Robot Development repository contains code for programming EV3 robots. The code is designed to provide various functions for robot movement, including turning, line following, and more. By utilizing these functions, users can easily control and program their EV3 robots for different tasks and challenges.

## General Information

The EV3 Robot Code repository provides a collection of functions to control EV3 robots. These functions are designed to simplify the process of programming robots by providing pre-defined commands for common actions. Users can utilize these functions and modify them as needed to suit their specific robot configurations and project requirements.

## Project Status

The EV3 Robot Code project is currently NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. We recommend using the EV3 App.

## Technologies Used

- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3
- EV3 Python Library

## Features

- Turning functions for precise robot rotation
- Line following functions for following a path or line on the ground
- Sensor integration for capturing data and making decisions based on input
- Motor control functions for controlling robot movement
- Modular code structure for easy integration and customization

## Setup

To use the EV3 Robot Code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have an EV3 robot kit and an EV3 brick.
2. Install the necessary software and drivers for the EV3 brick.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files.
4. Connect the EV3 brick to your computer.
5. Open the code in your preferred programming environment or IDE.
6. Upload the code to the EV3 brick and run it.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can utilize the provided functions in your own robot projects. Modify the code as necessary to suit your robot's configuration and desired functionality. Refer to the code documentation for detailed information on each function and its usage.

## Room for Improvement

Areas that could be improved and potential future development tasks include:

- Adding additional functions for advanced robot behaviors and actions
- Enhancing the code documentation and examples for better understanding
- Incorporating more sensor integration options for expanded functionality
